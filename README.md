# Integrating OpenAI Gym with Mesa

OpenAI Gym is a preferred choice for integrating reinforcement learning (RL) into Mesa due to its simplicity, wide range of environments, and strong community support. It provides a standardized API for developing and comparing RL algorithms, making it an ideal tool for enhancing Mesa's agent-based models with sophisticated decision-making capabilities.

## Why Choose OpenAI Gym?

- **Simplicity and Ease of Use:** Gym's straightforward API allows for quick experimentation and integration with Mesa models.
- **Diverse Environments:** Offers a variety of built-in environments for benchmarking and testing RL algorithms.
- **Community and Documentation:** Benefits from a large user base, extensive documentation, and active development.
- **Flexibility:** Easily create and integrate custom environments tailored to specific Mesa models.
- **Compatibility:** Works seamlessly with many state-of-the-art RL libraries, facilitating the application of advanced RL algorithms.

## Impact of Using Gym in Mesa

Integrating Gym with Mesa allows for the development of agent-based models where agents can learn and adapt their behavior through RL. This integration brings the following benefits:

- **Enhanced Decision-Making:** Agents can learn optimal strategies based on their interactions with the environment and other agents.
- **Complex System Dynamics:** Enables the exploration of emergent behaviors in complex systems through learned agent interactions.
- **Research and Education:** Provides a powerful tool for studying RL in multi-agent systems and for teaching concepts of both RL and agent-based modeling.

## How to Use Gym with Mesa

To use Gym with Mesa, follow these general steps:

1. **Define a Mesa Model:** Create your agent-based model using Mesa's framework.
2. **Create a Gym Environment:** Implement a custom Gym environment that wraps around your Mesa model. This involves defining the action space, observation space, and reward function.
3. **Integrate Gym and Mesa:** Modify your Mesa model to interact with the Gym environment, allowing agents to take actions based on policies learned through RL.
4. **Run and Evaluate:** Train your agents within the Gym environment and evaluate their performance.

## Structure of Integration

The integration typically involves three main components:

- **Mesa Model (mesa_model.py):** Defines the agent-based model, including agents and their behaviors.
- **Gym Environment (mesa_gym_env.py):** Wraps the Mesa model in a Gym environment, specifying how agents observe their surroundings, the actions they can take, and the rewards they receive.
- **Simulation Script (run_simulation.py):** Uses the Gym environment to run simulations, allowing agents to learn and adapt over time.

## Example

There is a example in the example folder name run_simulations.py. You can check that out as a example of this implementation.

This example demonstrates the basic workflow of integrating Mesa with OpenAI Gym, highlighting the ease of combining agent-based modeling with reinforcement learning to explore complex adaptive systems.
